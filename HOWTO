What actually Crypper is?

Crypper is a small (and useless) utility for those of you who want to encode/decode text based on a passphrase.
It's actually made of 2 scripts, one encoding and one decoding. The passphrase file stores the passphrase you are using to encode/decode.


Why should I use Crypper?

Just for fun. Or maybe you want to send a codified message to your friend.
Or let's say you have a list of porn sites you want to visit but you can't save the links in plain text. :P
In either cases, Crypper is fun.


How to use the scripts.

First you have to choose a passphrase. The passphrase must be 16, 24 or 32 characters long!
Basically all you have to do is to edit the file passphrase and enter one of your own.
The default passphrase is 1234567887654321.


Why is the passphrase so important?
The hash is generated and then decoded using the passphrase set up in the file.
For a different passphrase, the same text has another hash. It's basically how decoding works.
It's like the little game in your childhood when you set up with your friends your "secret language":

Ex:
1=a, 2=b, 3=c, etc. 

You could also rotate the alphabet making your "secret language" look like this:
1=z, 2=y, 3=x, etc.

The above numeric coding is how the passphrase, encoding and decoding works. Well, not just like that, but theoretically.
You encode your string using a secret passphrase. Everyone who knows your secret passphrase could also decode the encoded string.
Let's move on.

How to encode?

In a terminal open encode.py. You will be prompted to enter the text you want to encode. 
After you've finised entering it, press enter key, then strike Ctrl+D to generate the hash.
You can send the hash to your friend, store it somewhere, etc.


How to decode?

In a terminal open decode.py. You will be prompted to enter the hash. 
Press enter after pasting the hash and you will see the decoded text.
